Report of horz_binary with 0.1 tolerance to erroneous Euler angle offsets.

Test run on 12-12-2016.

If offset is in base file, and left sensor is offset, and hip sensor is offset, 
        horz_binary breaks when offset = > 30 degrees.

If offset is in session calib file, and hip sensor is offset, 
        horz_binary breaks when offset = > 30 degrees.

If offset is in practice file, and right sensor is offset, 
        horz_binary breaks when offset = > 30 degrees.
