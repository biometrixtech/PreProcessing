Report of contra_hip_drop_rf with 0.05 tolerance to erroneous Euler angle offsets.

Test run on 15-12-2016.

If offset is in base file, and left sensor is offset, and hip sensor is offset, 
        contra_hip_drop_rf breaks when offset = > 30 degrees.

If offset is in session calib file, and hip sensor is offset, 
        contra_hip_drop_rf breaks when offset = 1 degrees.

If offset is in practice file, and right sensor is offset, 
        contra_hip_drop_rf breaks when offset = > 30 degrees.
