Peak Detection v1.0 Documentation:

Modules Imported: numpy, pandas

peak_det
Description: Provides minima and maxima that exceed a threshold value from peak to trough. Data point is checked against currently marked local minimum
and maximum. If maximum is exceeded data point is marked as new local max, vice versa for the minimum. The position of the newly marked point is stored
in the associated maxpos and minpos variable. If this new point is either less than the local max minus the threshold or is greater than the local
min plus the threshold the local max/min is marked as an absolute max and min and is stored in the requisite max/min list along with its index. The
local max and min are then set to infinity (for max) or negative infinity (for min).

Inputs: v, data point (float); i, index of data point (int); mx, current local max value (float); mn, current local min value (float); mxpos, index
of current local max (int); mnpos, index of current local min (int); maxtab, list of lists containing previous absolute max values and indexes (list);
mintab, list of lists containing previous absolute min values and indexes (list)

Outputs: maxtab, list of lists containing previous absolute max values and indexes (list); mintab, list of lists containing previous absolute min values
and indexes (list); mx, current local max value (float); mn, current local min value (float); mxpos, index of current local max (int); mnpos, index of current
local min (int)
