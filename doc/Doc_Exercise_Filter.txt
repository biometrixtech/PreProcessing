Exercise Filter Documentation:

Description: Returns whether an athlete is currently doing a specified exercise or not. First the window used for the linear regression terms (.4*hz) is defined as well as the lower and upper
bound indices for the moving average calculation (total size .2*hz). Initialize regression object for accel regression and Euler angle regression. Calculate rolling average of z-axis accel, use lower and upper
bound to define window to average over. Calculate regression term for z-axis accel and EulerX over whole dataset. Check if rolling mean and both regression terms are below thresholds, if so determine no movement
under way and exercise not happening, otherwise determine exercise is happening.

Inputs: (1) .4*hz x 2 data object (with rows centered around data point of interest and 2 columns being 'AccZ' and 'EulerX'); string identifying exercise type; int identifying sampling rate (hz)
Outputs: int 1 or 0 (1 being no exercise, 0 exercise happening)
