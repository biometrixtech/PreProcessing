### PreProcessing
Analytics R&D: python scripts developed to clean, mark, and quanitify biomechanical errors

####In Progress - expected 6/17:
Phase Detection, Impact (status: released) identifies the impact phase, the second relevant phase

Load (status: discovery) major variable for reporting, contextualizes CMEs

Quantifying Balance CMEs (status: discovery) lying on top of the peak detect script, quantify max rotations for ie pronation, hip drop etc

####Release 1.0 (6/10/16)
Data Processing (status: released) transform sensor frame to body frame

Phase Detection, Balance (status: released) id foot not moving and in contact with the ground, create id for R/L single and double 

Peak Detection (status: released) id for max and min orientation values to input into CME detection

Execution (status: released) Data Processing > Phase Detection > Peak Detection

####Future Releases
6/24 - Quantifying Impact CMEs, Symmetry Reporting Mechanism

X-------Code Freeze for Alpha--------X

7/1 - Fatigue Reporting Mechanism, V2 Load

7/8 - Anatomical Reference for Body Frame Trasformation, Anything needed for Firmware Update 

7/X - Execution Reporting Mechanism, Constructive/Destructive Load Reporting Mechanism


#####(Statuses: discovery, method selected, testing, code review, released)
