# PreProcessing

##Analytics R&D: 
python scripts developed to clean, mark, and quanitify biomechanical errors

##In Progress - expected 6/17:
Phase Detection, Impact (status: code review) identifies the impact phase, the second relevant phase
Load (status: discovery) major variable for reporting, contextualizes CMEs
Quantifying Balance CMES (status: discovery) lying on top of the peak detect script, quantify max rotations for ie pronation, hip drop etc

##Release 1.0 (6/10/16)
Data Processing (status: released) transform sensor frame to body frame
Phase Detection, Balance (status: released) id foot not moving and in contact with the ground, create id for R/L single and double 
Peak Detection (status: released) id for max and min orientation values to input into CME detection
Execution (status: released) Data Processing > Phase Detection > Peak Detection


###(Statuses: discovery, method selected, testing, code review, released)
